# Scientific Python Cheat Sheet
simple overview of python, numpy, scipy, matplotlib functions that are useful
for scientific work. Tries to keep examples as compact as possible.

Click [here for the github markdown version](sheet.md) or [here for a web site layout](https://ipgp.github.io/scientific_python_cheat_sheet)

## Printing
Printing is a bit complicated so far if you want to have the same layout as on the webpage but possible: You can save the CSS layout as an image in firefox, using `shift + f2`, which opens the web console. The command `screenshot out.png --fullpage` saves the current complete view of the page to the download folder. We have found that aranging the page to have two columns is suitable for printing on A3 pages. A possibility is to use your browsers zoom function for this (e.g. strg + mouswheel on firefox). More columns are quickly too small. You can then print the long image on several sheets or you cut it in the pieces you want with the image software of your choice. Hopefully this will be simpler in the future !

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute, you only need to edit the file [sheet.md](sheet.md) and push it to the master branch (preferably via pull-request). The website updates automatically. 

If, beyond your knowledge of Python, you also master HTML and CSS, you can also contribute to the design of the website. You can submit your ideas via the issues section or directly via pull-request.
